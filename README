FAQ

Q: How do you interpret the results of webClass?
A: At this moment is time, webClass is purely a pattern classifer. webClass
   does not provide any reasoning or post classification logic. This may
   (and likely will) change in the future. When more indexes are created,
   a common classification langauge will emerge which will allow for cross
   index reasoning and more concise responses.

Q: How do I embed this technology into my application?
A: webClass is a simple web wrapper around dClass:
